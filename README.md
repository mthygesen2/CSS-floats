# _Floats_


#### By _**Mao Thygesen and Jeff Seymour **_

## Description

The idea of this application was to only use floats in order to make a basic layout. We used no bootstrap, tavles, inline-block. 
This was made to consider the amount of trouble developers have had in the past. 

There is a basic layout along with a replica of the treehouse library.
